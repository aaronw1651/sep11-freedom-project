<h1>Storing and Nesting Variables</h1>
<h3>An array is a data structure that lets you store an ordered collection of multiple values in a single variable. For example, let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];.</h3>

<h3>You can create a multi-dimensional array by placing an array inside another array. This is useful for representing grids or tables. For example, let matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];.</h3>
